This study aims to predict the future trajectory of **COVID-19 confirmed cases** in 
India and globally using the **Prophet model**, a time-series forecasting tool known for its 
ability to account for trends and seasonality in data. **Plotly** is used for generating interactive visuals. The model is trained on historical data, 
enabling robust predictions in the context of rapidly evolving conditions. The objective is to generate 
data-driven predictions to assist in understanding the potential trajectory of the pandemic, 
with a focus on minimizing uncertainty and improving decision-making. 

All the relevant files including detailed brief project report, dataset and jupyter notebook are uploaded.
